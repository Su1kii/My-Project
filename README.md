**My First Web Development Project**
Welcome to my first project as I dive into the world of web development! This project is a part of my journey toward becoming a software engineer, where I'm learning and applying foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**ðŸ“œ Project Overview**
This project is all about exploring front-end technologies and practicing basic web development concepts. As I continue to grow my skills, this project will evolve and serve as a reflection of my progress.

HTML: Structuring the content of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout design.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity to the web page.
**ðŸ“¢ About the Project**
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to web development, and I'm learning one step at a time. While it may not have the best code, there are some bugs, and the features arenâ€™t fully implemented yet, Iâ€™m excited to continue improving it! Also, itâ€™s not completely mobile-friendly yet, but Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more and refining my skills.

Stay tuned for updates as I keep pushing forward with this project!
